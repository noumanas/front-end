                  by U.S. tax law. Licensee shall not be required to make the
                  foregoing accounting if Licensor’s share of Net Revenue for
                  any given monthly period does not exceed one hundred dollars
                  ($100). Licensee may make adjustments for chargebacks and
                  refunds and shall have the right to maintain reasonable
                  reserves against returns and other adjustments, and shall
                  liquidate such reserves in accordance with its reasonable
                  practices, but in no event shall Licensee be required to
                  liquidate any reserve until the applicable distributor
                  liquidates the corresponding reserve. Licensee shall have the
                  absolute right in accounting to Licensor to rely upon the
                  statements received by Licensee from applicable distributors
                  and income sources and Licensee shall not be responsible in
                  any manner for any error, omission or other inaccuracy of any
                  such statement. Royalties for records sold for distribution
                  outside of the United States of America shall be computed in
                  the national currency in which License is paid by its
                  Licensees and shall be paid to Licensor at the same rate of
                  exchange at which Licensee is paid. (b) Notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, Licensee has no duty to pay Licensor its share of
                  Net Revenue pursuant to this Agreement, until any recoupable
                  advances paid to Licensor have been fully recouped. If
                  Licensee pays any advances or mutually-approved expenses, fees
                  or other payments to Licensor or on Licensor’s behalf (such
                  as, for example, any approved third party marketing, promotion
                  or advertising costs) and any such monies paid by Licensee
                  have not been fully recouped as of the date of Licensor’s
                  written notice requesting a termination of the Term, Licensee
                  may extend the Term beyond the scheduled termination or
                  expiration date through the last day of the calendar month in
                  which all such costs and any other amounts due and owing to
                  Licensee are fully recouped. No other forms of compensation
                  shall be due to Licensor from Licensee for the rights granted
                  herein, including but not limited to mechanical or public
                  performance royalties. (c) All statements rendered by Licensee
                  to Licensor pursuant to the above subparagraph 5(a) and all
                  other accounts, shall be binding upon Licensor and not subject
                  to any objection by Licensor for any reason unless specific
                  objection in writing, stating the basis thereof, is given to
                  Licensee within twelve (12) months from the date rendered.
                  Licensor shall be foreclosed from maintaining any action,
                  claim or proceeding against Licensee in any forum or tribunal
                  with respect to any statement or accounting due hereunder
                  unless such action, claim or proceeding is commenced against
                  Licensee in a court of competent jurisdiction within two (2)
                  years after the date such statement or accounting is rendered;
                  after such date such statement shall be binding. If Licensor
                  commences suit on any controversy or claim concerning Net
                  Revenue accountings rendered to Licensor under this Agreement
                  in a court of competent jurisdiction, the scope of the
                  proceeding will be limited to determination of the amount of
                  the Net Revenue due for the accounting periods concerned, and
                  the court will have no authority to consider any other issues
                  or award any relief except recovery of any royalties found
                  owing. Licensor’s recovery of its share of such Net Revenue
                  will be the sole remedy available to Licensor by reason of any
                  claim related to Licensor’s royalty accountings. Without
                  limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Licensor
                  will not have any right to seek termination of this Agreement
                  or avoid the performance of Licensor’s obligations under this
                  Agreement by reason of any such claim. (d) At any time within
                  twelve (12) months after any royalty statement is rendered to
                  Licensor hereunder, Licensor shall have the right to give
                  Licensee written notice of its intention to examine Licensee’s
                  books and records with respect to such statement. Such
                  examination shall be commenced and completed within six (6)
                  months after the date of such notice, at Licensor’s sole cost
                  and expense, by any certified public accountant, provided he
                  or she is not then engaged in an outstanding examination of
                  Licensee’s books and records on behalf of a person other than
                  you. Such examination shall be made during Licensee’s usual
                  business hours at the place where Licensee maintains the books
                  and records which relate to the rights hereunder and which are
                  necessary to verify the accuracy of the statement or
                  statements specified in Licensor’s notice to Licensee and the
                  examination shall be limited to the foregoing. Licensor’s
                  right to inspect such books and records shall be only as set
                  forth in this paragraph and Licensee shall have no obligation
                  to produce such books and records more than once with respect
                  to each statement rendered to Licensor. Licensor shall cause
                  Licensor’s accountant to deliver a copy of his or her audit
                  report to Licensee within three (3) months after the
                  completion of said accountant&apos;s examination of
                  Licensee&apos;s books and records. Licensor acknowledges that
                  Licensee’s books and records contain confidential trade
                  information. Neither Licensor nor its representatives will
                  communicate to others or use on behalf of any other person any
                  facts or information obtained as a result of such examination
                  of Licensee’s books and records. The rights granted herein to
                  Licensor constitute Licensor’s sole right to examine
                  Licensee&apos;s books and records.
                </p>
                <p>
                  6. Termination. Licensee may terminate the Term immediately:
                  (a) in the event of any material breach of this Agreement by
                  Licensor; (b) in the event that Licensor makes a general
                  assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) in the event
                  of the filing of a voluntary or involuntary petition against
                  Licensor under any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law,
                  provided, that Licensor will have a period of ninety (90)
                  consecutive days from its receipt of any involuntary petition
                  in bankruptcy filed against Licensor in which to cure before
                  Licensee may terminate the Term pursuant to this clause 8(c);
                  or (d) in the event of the appointment of a trustee or
                  receiver or any equivalent thereof for the Licensor or its
                  property. The termination or expiration of the Term will not
                  affect those representations, warranties and other obligations
                  that by their nature survive the end of the Term. Otherwise,
                  the Agreement shall automatically renew for successive and
                  consecutive one (1) year periods until terminated by either
                  party by either party providing notice to the other at least
                  60 days prior to the end of the applicable initial Term or
                  renewal period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  7. Representations and Warranties. (a) You warrant and
                  represent that it: (i) is an entity duly formed and/or
                  organized and validly subsisting pursuant to the laws of its
                  jurisdiction of formation and/or organization; that this
                  Agreement has been executed by a duly authorized
                  representative; and that it has the right, power and authority
                  to enter into this Agreement and to fully perform its
                  respective obligations hereunder. (b) Licensor further
                  warrants and represents that: (i) No materials, ideas or other
                  properties furnished by Licensor and embodied or contained in
                  or used in connection with the Master Recording(s) shall
                  violate any law or infringe upon any common law or statutory
                  rights of any party, including without limitation, contractual
                  rights, copyrights and rights of privacy. Without limiting the
                  generality of the foregoing, Licensor specifically represents
                  and warrants that (A) Licensor has obtained (or will obtain,
                  as applicable) all necessary consents, permissions and
                  clearances including, without limitation, from all persons
                  whose appearances, names, voices or likenesses are contained
                  in the Master Recording(s) and any promotional materials; (B)
                  As between Licensee and Licensor, Licensor has or will at its
                  own expense obtain and, to the extent required, pay for all
                  necessary performing rights from the copyright owners of the
                  Master Recording(s) and such other persons, firms or
                  associations, societies or corporations as may own or control
                  the performing rights thereto; (C) Licensor will not make any
                  agreements with or representations to any guilds or unions or
                  other third parties (including, without limitation, the
                  Artists performing in the Master Recording(s) which would
                  obligate Licensee to make any future payments to any third
                  parties in connection with Licensee’s exercise of the rights
                  herein granted to Licensee; (D) Licensor owns or controls, and
                  shall own and control, the rights necessary to make the grants
                  of rights, licenses and permissions hereunder and necessary
                  for Licensee to freely exploit the Master Recording(s), any
                  promotional materials, and rights granted to it herein to
                  effect the purpose of the Agreement, without the need for any
                  licenses, releases, consents, approvals not granted herein or
                  the requirement to make any payments of any nature to any
                  person (excluding solely the obligation to pay Licensor’s
                  share of Net Revenue in the manner described herein); (E) the
                  Master Recording(s) and any promotional materials do not and
                  will not (I) infringe on the proprietary or intellectual
                  property rights of any third party, including, without
                  limitation, copyrights, trademark rights and rights of
                  publicity and privacy or (II) violate any applicable laws
                  (including without limitation the laws and regulations
                  governing export control, unfair competition,
                  anti-discrimination or false advertising); (F) Licensor is not
                  aware that any third party claim has been made or threatened
                  with respect to the Master Recording(s) or any promotional
                  materials. (ii) Any metadata provided by Licensor shall be
                  complete and accurate and will confirm to all of Licensee’s
                  parameters for metadata and content specifications as provided
                  by Licensee. (iii) All of Licensor’s representations and
                  warranties shall be true and correct upon execution hereof and
                  shall remain in effect for so long as Licensee, its licensees,
                  assignees, transferees or successors in interest have any
                  rights in or to the Master Recording(s). Licensee’s acceptance
                  of the Master Recording(s) or other materials hereunder shall
                  not constitute a waiver of any of Licensor’s representations,
                  warranties or agreements in respect thereof. (iv) Licensee
                  shall not be required to make any payments of any nature for
                  or in connection with the acquisition, exercise or
                  exploitation of any rights granted to Licensee hereunder,
                  except as specifically provided in this Agreement. (v)
                  Licensor shall execute and deliver to Licensee, upon
                  Licensee&apos;s request therefor, any documents as may be
                  required by Licensee to effectuate the intent of this
                  Agreement, including, without limitation, any so-called
                  ‘inducement letters’. If Licensor shall fail or refuse to
                  execute and deliver any such inducement letter promptly
                  following Licensee&apos;s request therefor, Licensor hereby
                  appoints Licensee as Licensor’s true and lawful
                  attorney-in-fact to execute such inducement letter(s) in
                  Licensor’s name and on Licensor’s behalf. Such power of
                  attorney is irrevocable and is coupled with an interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  8. Indemnification. Each party hereto (for these purposes,
                  ‘Indemnitor’) shall indemnify, defend and hold the other party
                  (‘Indemnitee’) harmless against and in respect of any claims,
                  losses, damages or expenses (including, without limitation,
                  reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and litigation costs), that
                  Indemnitee may incur, which arise from or relate to any
                  alleged breach of, or failure by Indemnitor to perform, any of
                  Indemnitor&apos;s representations, warranties, or promises in
                  this Agreement or in any schedule, certificate, exhibit, or
                  other instrument furnished or to be furnished by Indemnitor
                  under or in connection with this Agreement. It is understood
                  that Indemnitor’s obligation to indemnify and defend pursuant
                  to this paragraph shall subsist regardless of whether
                  Indemnitor defeats the claim or the claim results in an
                  adverse judgment or settlement. Indemnitee shall notify
                  Indemnitor of any claim presented to Indemnitee by a third
                  party. Indemnitor shall defend any third-party claim, at its
                  sole expense, with counsel approved by Indemnitee, except
                  that, at Indemnitee&apos;s option, Indemnitee may defend the
                  claim (at Indemnitor&apos;s sole expense) and shall consult
                  with Indemnitor about choice of counsel and the conduct of the
                  proceeding. No such claim asserted by a third party may be
                  settled by Indemnitee without Indemnitor&apos;s prior written
                  consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
                  delayed), so long as Indemnitee is actively defending such
                  claim in a manner consistent with industry norms, unless
                  Indemnitee shall agree not to seek indemnity from Indemnitor
                  for any settlement payment made by Indemnitee to the claimant
                  and further subject to the following. If Indemnitor does not
                  approve a settlement proposed by Indemnitee, Indemnitee may
                  nonetheless settle the matter unless, within ten (10) business
                  days after notice to Indemnitor, Indemnitor furnishes to
                  Indemnitee a surety bond or letter of credit from a national
                  surety company or bank, in form and content satisfactory to
                  Indemnitee, insuring Indemnitee against the amount of the
                  claim in addition to reasonable attorney&apos;s fees and
                  litigation costs expended in connection with the claim and a
                  reasonable estimate of such fees and costs required to
                  continue the defense. If any claim shall be lodged with
                  Licensee or any action commenced having as its basis a claim
                  which, if proved, would constitute a breach by Licensor of any
                  of Licensor’s representations, warranties, or covenants
                  contained herein, Licensee, in addition to any other right or
                  remedy otherwise available, shall have the right to control
                  the defense thereof and settle same (subject to the above)
                  and, additionally, may withhold from any payments otherwise
                  due to Licensor hereunder an amount equivalent to that claimed
                  or sued for plus reasonable costs and attorney&apos;s fees
                  relating thereto. Any amount so withheld shall be credited to
                  Licensor’s account when Licensor shall have received
                  reasonable assurances that the claim or action has been
                  finally settled or fully adjudicated and the judgment
                  satisfied, or that the statute of limitations on such claim
                  has run, or when reasonable and adequate security for the
                  claim has been provided to Licensee.
                </p>
                <p>
                  9. Limitation of Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by
                  applicable law, in no event will Licensee be liable to
                  Licensor for any loss of use, data, goodwill, revenues, or
                  profits (whether or not deemed to constitute a direct loss),
                  or any consequential, special, indirect, incidental, punitive,
                  or exemplary loss, damage or expense of any kind arising out
                  of or in any way related to the Master Recordings, the Content
                  (as defined herein), or this Agreement, even if foreseeable or
                  even if Licensee has been advised or should have known of the
                  possibility of such damages. Licensee assumes no
                  responsibility for the downtime of Licensee’s CMS or
                  computers, Licensor’s network, or for the loss of information,
                  data records, or the Content. In no event will Licensee’s
                  total liability to Licensor for all damages, losses or causes
                  of action exceed the total amount of all types of revenue
                  actually received and retained by Licensee in the three (3)
                  months prior to the event which gave rise to the liability,
                  after deducting therefrom amounts paid or due to you in
                  respect thereof.{" "}

                <p>
                  10. Relationship & Taxes. (a) Licensor and Licensee hereby
                  acknowledge and agree that their relationship is strictly and
                  solely that of independent contractors, and that neither
                  Licensor nor any of Licensor’s employees, agents or
                  representatives is or shall be construed as an employee of
                  Licensee, or otherwise entitled to any benefits or insurance
                  provided by Licensee, including any unemployment or disability
                  benefits. Nothing contained herein shall grant Licensor any
                  right, power or authority to bind the Licensee to any
                  obligations. (b) Each party hereto will be responsible for
                  collecting and remitting any and all applicable taxes due with
                  respect to (or incurred in connection with) the sale or
                  license of such party’s goods or services to its customers.
                  Except as expressly set forth below, neither party will be
                  liable for any taxes, duties, levies, fees, excises or tariffs
                  incurred in connection with or related to the sale of the
                  other party’s goods or services. Notwithstanding the forgoing
                  or anything elsewhere in this Agreement, any and all monies
                  payable to Licensor hereunder will be reduced by all
                  applicable sales, use, excise, purchase, value-added or
                  similar taxes properly due and paid or payable by Licensee and
                  its affiliates to taxing authorities with appropriate
                  jurisdiction. If any amounts are required under law to be
                  withheld from any payments to Licensor under this Agreement,
                  Licensee will be entitled to withhold such amounts. Nothing
                  contained herein shall grant Licensor any right, power or
                  authority to bind the Licensee to any obligations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  11. Confidentiality. Neither party (the ‘Receiving Party’)
                  will disclose the terms of this Agreement or any Confidential
                  Information (as defined herein) of the other party (the
                  ‘Disclosing Party’) to any third-party except: (a) as may be
                  required by any court of competent jurisdiction, governmental
                  agency, law or regulation (in such event, the Receiving Party
                  shall notify the Disclosing Party before such disclosure so as
                  to give the Disclosing Party an opportunity to apply for a
                  confidentiality order or similar remedy); (b) as part of the
                  normal reporting or review procedure to the Receiving Party’s
                  accountants, auditors, employees, legal counsel, and employees
                  of partners, parent and subsidiary need to know to perform
                  their regular responsibilities to the Receiving Party may be
                  disclosed to such persons, and provided further that the
                  Receiving Party will be responsible to the Disclosing Party
                  for any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information by
                  them; (c) information which has entered the public domain
                  through no fault of the Receiving Party or any persons to whom
                  the Receiving Party has provided Confidential Information as
                  permitted hereunder; and (d) with the prior written consent of
                  the Disclosing Party. As used herein, ‘Confidential
                  Information’ shall mean the terms of this Agreement and any
                  non¬public information, data, usage reports, revenue reports,
                  Unauthorized Content (as defined herein) identification
                  techniques, Content Claiming (as defined in Exhibit A)
                  methods, or other materials provided by one party to the other
                  under or in connection with this Agreement (other than the
                  Content, promotional materials and other information intended
                  for storage and display to end users or prospective end users
                  under this Agreement) and any other information the receiving
                  party should reasonably have understood under the
                  circumstances should be treated as confidential, whether or
                  not the specific designation ‘confidential’ or any similar
                  designation is used, such as royalty statements and similar
                  information. Neither party shall use any Confidential
                  Information except as necessary for the express purpose of
                  carrying out its respective obligations under this Agreement.
                  The terms of this paragraph 11 shall survive the expiration or
                  termination of the Agreement.

                  communication is to be given at the address set forth at the
                  head of this Agreement or such other address as such party

                  accordance herewith.
                </p>
                <p>
                  13. Credit. Licensee shall accord Licensor an appropriate
                  credit in connection solely with the initial release of the
                  Master Recording(s) hereunder. Licensee&apos;s inadvertent
                  failure to comply with any of its obligations under this
                  paragraph 13 shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement.
                  Each party may issue a press release concerning the existence
                  of this Agreement with the other party’s prior approval, not
                  to be unreasonably withheld.
                </p>
                <p>
                  the other party’s prior approval, not to be unreasonably
                  withheld. 14. Miscellaneous. 1. Merger. The terms set forth in
                  this Agreement and all exhibits and attachments hereto,
                  constitute the entire understanding between Licensee and
                  Licensor with respect to the subject matter hereof, all prior
                  and/or contemporaneous negotiations and understandings being
                  merged herein. This Agreement cannot be canceled, modified,
                  amended or waived, in part or in full, in any way except by an
                  instrument in writing signed by the party to be charged. 1.
                  Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions
                  of this Agreement is invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the
                  enforceability of remaining provisions shall be unimpaired. If
                  any provision of this agreement, or any part thereof, is found
                  to be invalid or unenforceable, the same shall not affect the
                  remaining provisions, which shall be given full effect,
                  without regard to the invalid portions. Moreover, if any one
                  or more of the provisions contained in this agreement shall be
                  held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity
                  or subject, such provisions shall be construed by limiting and
                  reducing them so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent
                  with applicable law. (c) Headings. The headings of the
                  articles and sections used in this Agreement are included for
                  convenience only and are not to be used in construing or
                  interpreting this Agreement. (d) Modification; Waiver; Rights
                  and Remedies. No waiver by Licensee or Licensor whether
                  express or implied, of any provision of this Agreement or any
                  default hereunder shall affect the other&apos;s right to
                  thereafter enforce such provision or to exercise any right or
                  remedy in the event of any other default, whether or not
                  similar. Those provisions of any applicable collective
                  bargaining agreement between Licensee and any labor
                  organization which are required, by the terms of such
                  agreement to be included in this Agreement shall be deemed
                  incorporated herein. (e) Invalid Provisions. Nothing in this
                  Agreement may be construed to require the commission of any
                  act contrary to laws; provided that, in the event there is a
                  conflict between any provisions of this Agreement and any law,
                  contrary to which the parties hereto have no legal right to
                  contract, (i) the provision of this Agreement so affected will
                  be limited only to the extent necessary to permit the
                  compliance with the minimum legal requirements, (ii) no other
                  provisions of this Agreement will be affected thereby, and
                  (iii) all such other provisions will remain in full force and
                  effect. The parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to
                  replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (the
                  ‘Invalid Provision’) with a valid provision, the effect of
                  which comes as close as possible to that of the Invalid
                  Provision. (f) Choice of Law and Venue. This Agreement shall
                  be governed by and construed under the laws and judicial
                  decisions of the State of California without giving effect to
                  the conflict of laws principles of California. All claims,
                  disputes or disagreements which may arise out of the
                  interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement shall
                  be submitted exclusively to the jurisdiction of the state
                  courts of the State of California or the United States
                  District Courts located in Los Angeles; provided, however, if
                  Licensee is sued or joined in any other court or forum in
                  respect of any matter which may give rise to a claim by
                  Licensee hereunder, Licensor consents to the jurisdiction of
                  such court or forum over any such claim which may be asserted
                  by Licensee. (g) Non-Disparagement. Neither party will will
                  ridicule, disparage or demean the reputation of the other
                  Party. Nothing herein shall prevent the parties from making
                  any truthful statement in connection with any legal proceeding
                  or investigation by either Party or any governmental
                  authority. (h) Assignment. This Agreement will be binding upon
                  and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted
                  successors and assigns. Licensee may assign this Agreement to
                  any subsidiary, affiliated or controlling corporation, or to
                  any person owning or acquiring a substantial portion of the
                  stock or assets of Licensee. Licensee may also assign and/or
                  sublicense its rights hereunder to the extent necessary or
                  advisable in Licensee’s sole discretion to implement the
                  license granted or to any third-party assignee as set forth
                  herein. Licensor may not assign this Agreement or any of your
                  rights hereunder and any such purported assignment shall be
                  void. 1. Force Majeure. Neither party hereto will be
                  responsible for, or be in breach of this Agreement, to the
                  extent that its performance is frustrated or delayed as a
                  result of any act of God, war, terrorism, pandemic/epidemic,
                  fire, earthquake, civil commotion, act of government or any
                  other cause wholly beyond its control and not due to its own
                  negligence or that of its contractors or representatives, and
                  which cannot be overcome by the exercise of due diligence. 1.
                  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by digital
                  signature in one or more counterparts, via digital PDF copy,
                  each of which shall be an original; but such counterparts
                  shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. 1.
                  Cure. Neither party shall be in default of any term,
                  condition, or provision of this agreement unless and until the
                  other party gives written notice specifying such default in
                  detail and such default, if curable, shall not have been cured
                  within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice. For the
                  avoidance of doubt, any breach by Licensor of its exclusivity
                  provisions hereunder shall not be a curable breach. Licensor
                  acknowledges and agrees that Licensor has read this Agreement
                  and have been advised by Licensee of the significant
                  importance of retaining an independent attorney of Licensor’s
                  choice to review this Agreement on Licensor’s behalf. Licensor
                  acknowledges and agrees that Licensor has had the unrestricted
                  opportunity to be represented by an independent attorney. In
                  the event of Licensor’s failure to obtain an independent
                  attorney or waiver thereof, Licensor hereby warrants,
                  represents and agrees that Licensor will not attempt to use
                  such failure and/or waiver as a basis to avoid any obligations
                  under this Agreement, or to invalidate this Agreement or to
                  render this Agreement or any part thereof unenforceable. IN
                  WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this
                  Agreement on the day and year first above written.

                  sublicensee, in accordance with Create Music Group’s or

                  Create Music Group’s sublicensee, of Your Artwork (including
                  any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to Your benefit.

                  5. Audio Matching License. You hereby grant to Create Music
                  Group, and Google as Create Music Group’s sublicensee, a

                  Your Reference Files and ID Files for Audio Matching in
                  connection with the Music Search Service. At the request of
                  End Users utilizing the Music Search Service, the System will
                  compare ambient audio to the ID Files corresponding to Your
                  References Files to identify Your Content contemporaneously
                  with the ambient performance of such content. If the System
                  detects an Audio Match, Google may provide the End User with
                  an opportunity to purchase or listen to Your Content.
